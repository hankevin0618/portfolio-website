    		<h3> Visualise thoughts </h3>
    			<p> Through a few years of courses, practices, and work experiences, I am able to depict, illustrate my ideas quickly. The key concepts of my design style are simple, clear, easy to understand, and making senses. For graphic design skills, I am able to use Adobe design tools fluently such as: <br> <strong> Photoshop, Illustrator, Indesign, and XD </strong>.</p>

    		<h3> Visualisation to Prototype </h3>
    			<p> At University, I found that the ability of programming is a huge benefit for designers as making the design more realistic and accurate. Therefore, I enrolled to IT for my second major to acquire the programming skills and knowledge.</p> 

    			<p>Through a number of units, I have learned diverse programming languages such as <strong>Python, C#, Java, Database(SQL), HTML, CSS,</strong> as well as a bit of Javascript (which I will study more by myself), Arduino, and Processing. These programming units taught me to understand the broad computer languages based on detailed programming principles.</p>

    			<p> I achieved high results for the most of group assessments at University. It was such a luck that I met good team members, but also I believe I affected the team to concentrate and progress for higher achievement. </p>
    			<p>There are some good examples for you to know how I collaborated with diverse groups in different units such as <strong>IoT, Social Technologies, and Tangible Media.</strong> This portfolio will demonstrate my characteristics, attitude, and capabilities in different teams. </p>
